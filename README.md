# njump.to

Fast, reliable redirect service that provides a single URL (`https://njump.to/`) that automatically forwards users to a random njump mirror instance. Deployed on Vercel Edge Functions for maximum speed and global distribution.

## How it works

The service provides a single, memorable URL (`https://njump.to/`) that automatically forwards to a random njump mirror, eliminating the need to remember or choose between multiple instances.

- Randomly selects from: njump.me, nostr.at, nostr.eu, nostr.ae, nostr.com
- Preserves all paths and query parameters
- Runs on Vercel's edge network for sub-10ms response times
- Zero dependencies, minimal code

### Examples

- `https://njump.to/` → redirects to random njump instance
- `https://njump.to/npub1abc...` → redirects to random instance with the npub
- `https://njump.to/nevent1xyz...` → redirects to random instance with the nevent
- `https://njump.to/nostr.com` → redirects to random instance with NIP-05 profile

## Mirror List

The service randomly forwards to one of the following njump mirror instances:

- [njump.me](https://njump.me)
- [nostr.at](https://nostr.at)
- [nostr.eu](https://nostr.eu)
- [nostr.ae](https://nostr.ae)
- [nostr.com](https://nostr.com)
